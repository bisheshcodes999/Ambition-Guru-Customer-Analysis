Ambition Guru: Customer Behavior & Conversion Analysis

🎯 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of over 3000,000 student records from Ambition Guru, a leading EdTech platform. The goal was to transform raw customer data into actionable business insights regarding enrollment trends, demographic behavior, and monetization efficiency.

🚀 Key Insights & Business Value
Monetization Efficiency: Identified an overall conversion rate of 11.35%, with a specific focus on the "Trial-to-Paid" pipeline which shows a 33% lead quality ratio.

High-Value Demographics: While 15-20 year olds (School Students) make up the largest volume of users, the 26-40 age group (Young Professionals) exhibits the highest conversion efficiency at 32%.

Geographic Hotspots: Kathmandu leads in both total enrollments and revenue, though specific provinces like Bagmati show the highest concentration of paid subscribers.

Product Performance: Discovered that specific exam preparation packages (e.g., Nepali-2081) achieve conversion rates as high as 75%, suggesting a strong market fit for localized content.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Data Cleaning: SQL (MySQL) used for handling NULLs, standardizing 500+ package names, and deduplication.
